# variables
# variable has a name
# , has a value
# , has an address
# ,has a size
# ,and has a type

i = 3 # int
f = 4.5 #float 
b = True # Boole 
s = "hello"
msg = 'Hello world!'
ch = 'a' # it is still a string

print(i, type(i))
print(f, type(f))
print(s, type(s))
print(msg, type(msg))
print(b, type(b))
print(ch, type(ch) )

# Variable names
# can use letters, digits and _ only ( you can't have  a comma in a name for example)
# it can't start with a number
# it can start with _ but you shouldn't use it ( because it has a different meaning)
# use meaningful variable names 

#example 
circle_radius = 5
PI  = 3.14
circle_radius = 6 # reassignment
area_of_circle  = PI * circle_radius * circle_radius

print("The area of the circle is: ", area_of_circle)

# Operations

a = 3+4
b = 4-3
c = 4*3
d = 3/4
d_ = 3//4 # floor division
e = 4%3 # The result is the remainder after division 
f = 3**3 # power
print(a, type(a))
print(b, type(b))
print(c, type(c))
print(d, type(d))
print(d_, type(d_))
print(e, type(e))
print(f, type(f))

# combining variables

e = a+b # process the assignment from right to left
# it means evalue a+b first, then add the result to the variable e

print("The value of e is ", e)


#static type vs dynamic type

x = 5 # type int
print(x, type(x))
x = 4.3 # x changed its type to be float
print(x, type(x))
x = "Hello " # x changed to str
print(x, type(x))
x = True  # x changed to Bool
print(x, type(x))

# casting

x = 3    #int
y = 4    #int
z = x/y  #float, automatic casting

print(z)

# manual casting (explicit casting)

int(z)
print(int(z))

print(int("43"))

print(str(43))

x = 1
print(x, type(x))

y = float(x)
print(y, type(y))

v = 4.3
